## 🧠 Problem Statement

In most hostels, complaint handling is **manual**, involving registers or verbal reporting to wardens.  
This leads to:
- Untracked or delayed resolutions  
- Lack of accountability  
- Overburdened maintenance staff  

**QuickFix** aims to solve this by creating a **digital complaint management portal** that ensures transparency and faster resolution.
